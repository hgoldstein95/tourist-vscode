Bug fixes
=========
- Relative paths do not work
    - *Should it be possible to specify a root path in .tour file?*

Creating tours
==============
- "New tour" command
    - Perhaps from File > New tour
- "New tourstop" command
    - Available from right click context menu and keyboard shortcut
    - *How should it decide on regex? (or use something else?)*
- Re-arrange tourstops in GUI
- Delete tourstops in GUI

Other ideas
===========
- If something changes, compare to what's stored and suggest 'closest' line?
