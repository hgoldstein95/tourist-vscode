Bug fixes
=========
- Relative paths do not work
    - *Should it be possible to specify a root path in .tour file?*

Creating tours
==============
- "New tour" command
    - Perhaps from File > New tour
- Re-arrange tourstops in GUI
- Delete tourstops in GUI

Better tour-taking experience
=============================
- Show description under tourstop in sidebar
- "Next tourstop"/"Previous tourstop" commands
- Maybe visual marker of tourstop in editor

Other ideas
===========
- If something changes, compare to what's stored and suggest 'closest' line?
- Rethink:  if multiple .tour files exist on the top level, one is chosen arbitrarily
- *How should "new tourstop" decide on regex? (or use something else?)*
