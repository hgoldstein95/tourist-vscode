Bug fixes
=========
- Relative paths do not work
    - *Should it be possible to specify a root path in .tour file?*

Creating tours
==============
- Re-arrange tourstops in GUI
- Delete tourstops in GUI
- Ability to save .tour file

Better tour-taking experience
=============================
- Show description under tourstop in sidebar
- "Next tourstop"/"Previous tourstop" commands
- Visual marker(s) of tourstop in editor
    - Gutter icon
    - Line background
    - Config which/either/both, color
- Codelens?

Other ideas
===========
- If something changes, compare to what's stored and suggest 'closest' line?
- Rethink:  if multiple .tour files exist on the top level, one is chosen arbitrarily
- *How should "new tourstop" decide on regex? (or use something else?)*
