# Tourist for Visual Studio Code

## What's all this about?
Tourist is a tool for documenting your code through "tours", similarly to how an experienced developer may introduce a newer dev to a codebase.

## Running the code
This project is a Visual Studio Code plugin. In order to run the plugin, open
the top-level directory in VSCode and simply run the debugger.

A new editor window should open with the Tourist extension running!
